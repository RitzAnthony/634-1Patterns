    Question: Explain the difference between the class adapter ant the object adapter:

    Class Adapter uses inheritance and can only wrap a class. It cannot wrap an interface since by definition it must derive from some base class.

    Object Adapter uses composition and can wrap classes or interfaces, or both. It can do this since it contains, as a private, encapsulated member, the class or interface object instance it wraps.
